# 🐹 Learn Go (Golang)

Welcome! 👋  
This repository is my **Go learning doc**, but I’ve structured it so **anyone can learn Go basics** step by step.  
If you’re new to Go, you can follow along with the examples and theory notes here.

## 📖 What is Go (Golang)?

- Go (often called **Golang**) is a modern, open-source programming language developed by **Google**.
- Known for:
  - 🚀 **Performance** (compiled, fast like C/C++)
  - 🔧 **Simplicity** (clean syntax, fewer keywords)
  - ⚡ **Concurrency** support (goroutines, channels)
  - 🌍 **Cross-platform** builds (easy to compile anywhere)
- Go is widely used in **backend development**, **cloud-native apps**, **DevOps tools (like Docker & Kubernetes)**, and **microservices**.

## 🎯 Goal

This repo is **not just my notes** — it’s designed to be a **beginner-friendly guide** for learning Go.  
You can clone it, run the examples, and learn Go step by step.
